## Introduction

- Why Transformation
  - Modeling
    - Moving the objects to the desired location
    - Multiple instances of a protostype stape
    - Kinematics of linkages/skeletons - character animation
  - Viewing
    - projection transforms
- Types
  - Linear (preserves parallel lines)
    - Translation
    - Rotation
    - Scaling
  - projection: perspective/orthographic projection
  - non-linear: twists, bends, warps, morphs
- Implementation: Metrics
  - Representation with a $4\times 4$ matrix: Homogeneous coordinates
