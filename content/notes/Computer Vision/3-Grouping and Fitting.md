## Grouping

- Goals
  - Gather features that belong together
  - obtain an intermediate representation that cmopactly describes key image or video parts
- Top down segmentation: pixels belong together because they are from the same object
- Bottom up segmentation: pixels belong together because they look similar
- Gestalt Theory
  - Whole is greater than sum of its parts
  - Relationships among parts can yield new properties/features

## Segmentation

- K-means clustering
- Probabilistic clustering
- Mixture of Gaussians
- GMM
- Mean-shift Algorithm
