- Image(video) -> (sensing device) -> (interpreting device) -> Interpretations
- Automatic understanding of images and video
  - Measurement: Computing properties of the 3D world from visual data
  - Perception and interpretation: Algorithms and representations to allow a machine to recognize objects, scene and people
