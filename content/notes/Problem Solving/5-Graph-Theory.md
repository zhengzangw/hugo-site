  - **_Konig Theorem_**: For nonempty partite graph, $\chi'(X)=\Delta(G)$

## Ramsey Numbers

- Ramsey's Theorem: $\forall k+1\geq 3$ positive integers $t,n_1,n_2,\cdots,n_k,\exists n>0,\forall S\subseteq \mathbb{Z}_{n},|S|=t$ is colored with one of $k$ colors, then $\exists S$ containing $n_i$ elements such that every $t$-element subset of $S$ is colored $i$
  - ($t=2$) $\forall k\geq 2,n_1,n_2,\cdots,n_k,\exists n>0,E(K_n)$ is colored by $k$ colors that $\exists i$, complete subgraph $K_{n_i}$ is colored $i$
- Ramsey's number $r(F_1,F_2)$: the smallest positive integer n such that if every edge of Kn is colored red or blue in any manner whatsoever, then either a red F1 or a blue F2 is produced
