## Existence by Counting

* Shannon 1949: There is a boolean function $f:\{0,1\}^n\rightarrow\{0,1\}$ which cannot be computed by any circuit with $\frac{2^n}{3n}$ gates
  * $f$ computable by $t$ gates: $2^{2^n}$
  * circuits with $t$ gates: $<2^t(2n+t+1)^{2t}$

## Double Counting

* Handshaking Lemma: $\sum_{v\in V}d(v)=2|E|$
* Sperner's Lemma(1928): For any properly colored trangulation, there existst a cell receiving all three colors
  * trangulation: a decompostion of $abc$ to small triangles(cells) such that any two different cells are either disjoint or share and edge of vertex
  * proper coloring: color with 3 color that
    * $a,b,c$ has different color
    * The vertices in each of the three lines $ab,bc,ac$ receive two colors
* Brouwer's fixed point theorem (1911)
  * $\forall$ continous function $f:B\rightarrow B$ of an $n$-dimensional ball, $\exists$ a fixed point $x=f(x)$
  
## Pigeonhole Principle

* General Pigeonhole Principle: If a set consisting of more than $mn$ objects is partitioned into $n$ classes, then some class receives more than $n$ objects.
* Inevitable divisors
* Monotonic subsequences
* Dirichlet's approximation: $x$ is an irrational number, $\forall n\in\mathbb{N},\exists\frac{p}{q},1\leq q\leq n$ and $|x-\frac{p}{q}|<\frac{1}{nq}$
