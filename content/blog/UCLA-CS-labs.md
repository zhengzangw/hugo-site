Center for Vision, Cognition, Learning and Autonomy

* Research Interest:
  * Vision: image and video parsing, scene understanding, scheduling top-down/bottom-up processes, spatial-temporal-causal and-or graphs;
  * Cognition: functionality, intuitive physics, intentionality, perceptual causality, theory-of-mind, and visual persuasion;
  * Learning: information projection, stochastic grammars, and-or graph learning, and lifelong communicative learning;
  * Autonomy: human robot collaboration, multi-agent task planning, situated dialogue, human value and moral norm.
* Objective: to pursue a unified framework for representation, learning, inference and reasoning, and to build intelligent computer systems for real world applications
